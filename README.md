# Challenge 5 (Work Day Scheduler)

## Description 
For this challenge I was asked to create a work scheduler. At the top of the page you'll notice the current date. 
It also consists of 9 time blocks between the hours of 9am and 5pm. In each time block you can input what you need to do for that hour and save it as a friendly reminder.

Speaking of reminders, the color of each time block is dynamic and will change depending on the current time. Grey for the past, Red for the present, and green for the future!
